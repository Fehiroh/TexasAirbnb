# TexasAirbnb

This acts as a stable location to store the csv data belonging to AirBnBs in Texas, USA. It was put here as a method of insuring multiple applications could access the raw data remotely via RCurl without having to spend money on a cloud-hosted database or deal with potential problems with having users download the information into local storage. To see where this data was actually utilized, please see [My Data Manipulation](https://github.com/Fehiroh/PriceMapDistribution)
